Live site here: https://seanclark.github.io/Cylinder-Selector/
This app was created to help with product support calls for a lock manufacturer. Often it is difficult to know
all of the details of each cylinder type while helping a customer. 
The user inputs the cylinder type into the utility and it outputs the details. 
Javascript, HTML & CSS where used along with a small amount of Bootstrap for styling.
